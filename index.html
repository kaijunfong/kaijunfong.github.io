              </header>
              <p>
                I am a business analytics student from the National University
                of Singapore specialising in Machine Learning. This portfolio
                showcases some of my projects both from school and as a hobby,
                as well as my work experiences, awards, and certifications. I
                take pride in improving processes through code and understanding
                the world through its data. <br /><i
                  >"Rough start but good finish"</i
                >
                is a personal motto of mine, reflecting my belief in seeing
                things through to the end despite any steep initial learning
                curves. I am a resilient individual, aspiring to make a
                difference in people's lives through technology and data.

              <p>
                As part of BT4222: Mining Web Data for Business Insights, our
                team created a movie recommendation system that aims to tackle
                the business issue of improving the level of satisfaction and
                engagement of users in mainstream movie streaming platforms. My
                primary task was to conduct the exploratory data analysis and
                feature engineering, and I also played a part in helping with
                the Neural Collaborative filtering and Neural Matrix
                Factorisation models, achieving a best F1 score of 0.7989.
